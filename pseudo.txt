I need to create a welcome page for the start of the quiz.

I need a clickable button to start the quiz

I need the quiz to be timed

When the quiz starts,
    the content of the page needs to change to the first question.
        I need to change text content and append changes
    a visible timer needs to start

For each question
    The timer needs to remain consistent
    the page needs to change to show a new question and 4 multiple choice answers
        I need to change text content and append changes
    a correct answer needs to increase the user score
    an incorrect answer needs to penalize quiz timed

When the quiz is over
    I need to change text content and append changes
    I need to show their total score
    I need to record the score in memory
    I need to compare the score to others
    I need to rank the score relative to other recorded scores

basic needed Variables:
    timer: number
    score: number
    answerCorrect: boolean
    answerConfirm: boolean
    quizStart: boolean

I don't need variables to specify false answers. they can be an 'else' case.
I DO need to specify which answer has value 'true' 

when a false answer is selected, I need to reduce the timer by the desired value (5s?)
When the timer hits 0, I need to bring the user to the results page.

I need to use DOM Manipulation to connect my script to the buttons in the page.

need array of objects for questions

    var questions = [];
